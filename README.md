# Stopwatch

A REDCap External Module that provides a stopwatch widget that can be integrated into data entry forms or surveys. Results (elapsed time, times started/stopped) can be captured in a number of ways.

## Bugs / Feature Requests

In case of bugs, or for feature requests, please visit this module's [GitHub](https://github.com/davwillev/stopwatch) page and open an issue.

## Installation

- Clone this repo into `<redcap-root>/modules/stopwatch_v<version-number>`, or
- Obtain this module from the Consortium REDCap Repo via the Control Center.
- Go to Control Center > Technical / Developer Tools > External Modules and enable this module.
- Enable the module for any projects that want to make use of it.

## Use

- To include a stopwatch on a form or survey,
  - create a field of a type compatible with storing a stopwatch result (see below), and add the **@STOPWATCH** action tag,
  - or add the **@STOPWATCH** action tag to _any_ field, and define a separate `target` field to hold the stopwatch result using the action tag parameters.
- The field with the action tag will be referred to as "the @STOPWATCH field".
- In the @STOPWATCH field, the stopwatch widget will be shown in the label or data area, depending on whether the `target` is a different field or the @STOPWATCH field.
- Multiple stopwatches can be used on the same form.
- Each stopwatch must have a unique `target`.
- Only one **@STOPWATCH** action tag can be used within each field.

## Action Tag Configuration

The stopwatch is configured using action tag parameters. The parameter string must be written as valid JSON (see [https://jsonlint.com/](https://jsonlint.com/)). The following parameters are supported. _All are optional._

```json
@STOPWATCH=
{
  "string": "value",
  "bool": true,
  "number": 5
}
```

_Note:_ When providing parameters, the equal sign `=` must touch the action tag (i.e. there must be no space between)! There may be whitespace (even line breaks) between `=` and the opening curly brace.

- `mode` - Mode can be one of the following:
  - `basic` - A simple stopwatch with start/stop and reset buttons. The elapsed time is recorded. This is the default.
  - `capture` - A stopwatch that can record multiple captures of the (until then) elapsed time (see below for details). `@STOPWATCH-CAPTURE` can be used as a shortcut.
  - `lap` - A stopwatch that can record multiple laps (see below for details). `@STOPWATCH-LAP` can be used as a shortcut.

- `id` - An identifier for the stopwatch. If this is not specified, the name of the `target` field will be used. This is useful when storing the data of multiple stopwatches within a single repeating instrument (see below).

- `target` - The field in which the elapsed time is to be stored. By default, this will be the @STOPWATCH field (in which case its type and validation must be compatible - see below).

- `show_target` - Boolean (`true`|`false`) that determines whether the target input should be shown on data entry forms (default to `false`).

- `show_target_survey` - Boolean (`true`|`false`) that determines whether the target input should be hidden (default to `false`).

- `resume` - Boolean (`true`|`false`) that determines whether stopping and resuming the timer is allowed (defaults to `false`).

- `digits` - The precisison to show (0, 1, 2, or 3).

- `h_digits`, `m_digits`, `s_digits` - The (minimal) number of digits to use for hours, minutes, seconds (when shorter, values will be padded with 0).

- `no_hours` - Boolean (`true`|`false`). If set to `true`, minutes will be the largest unit counted.

- `no_minutes` - Boolean (`true`|`false`). If set to `true`, seconds will be the largest unit ounted. This will imply `no_hours` = `true`.

- `decimal_separator` - The decimal separator that is inserted between seconds and fractional econds. This will be overriden by certain target field types.

- `group_separator` - The character(s) inserted between hours, minutes, seconds.

- `unset_display_symbol` - The symbol to be used as a digit replacement when no value has been set.

- `display_format` - The format for display in the stopwatch widget.

- `display_running` - When set, this will be displayed when the stopwatch is currently running.

- `display_empty` - When set, this will be displayed when the stopwatch has no value(s).

### Additional configuration for capture and lap modes

Data from a stopwatch capturing multiple timepoints ('splits') or laps, by default, is stored as a JSON data structure inside a _Notes Box_ or _Text Box_ (without validation), unless `mapping` is specified, in which case the data is stored in the fields of another form. In the latter case, `target` must still exist and be a _Text Box_ without validation, as some metadata needs to be stored there (this field should typically not be shown and made read only).

- `mapping` - A JSON object with the following keys. All except `elapsed` are optional. All fields must be on the same repeating instrument, separate from the @STOPWATCH field. The exact storage format depends on the chosen field type (see below).
  - `id` - Field for storing the id of the stopwatch. This must be a _Text Box_ without validation. This mapping is useful when capturing the data from multiple stopwatches in the same repeating instrument.
  - `elapsed` - Field for storing the elapsed time. This mapping **must** be provided.
  - `start` - Field for storing the date/time the capture was (first) started.
  - `stop` - Field for storing the date/time the capture was (last) stopped.
  - `index` - Field for storing the index (starting at 1) of the lap/capture within a measurement (the target field must be of type integer).
  - `cumulated` (`lap` mode only) - Field for storing the cumulated elapsed time.
  - `num_stops` (`lap` mode only) - Field for storing the number of times the timer was stopped during recording of a lap (the target field must be of type integer).
  - `is_stop` (`capture` mode only) - Field for storing the stop flag (the target field must be of type integer - it will hold 0 or 1).

- `event` - The name (or numerical id) of the event of the repeating form with the capture or lap mapping fields. If not specified, the current event is assumed.

- `only_once` - Boolean (`true`|`false`) determining whether the stopwatch can be used again once a value has been recorded. The default is `false`.

- `max_rows` - The maximum number of rows to show in the captures/laps table. Default = 0 (no limit).

- `at_top` - Boolean (`true`|`false`) determining whether the stopwatch is shown vertically aligned at the top. The default is `true`.

- `cumulated` (available in `lap` mode only) - Boolean (`true`|`false`). If set to `true`, an additional column with cumulated elapsed time will be shown.

### Format of the stored values

Stopwatch will honor the format (validation) of the target field(s). The target field has to be of type _Text Box_ or _Notes Box_.

Elapsed time will be stored as follows:

- _Integer_: elapsed time in milliseconds.
- _Number_: elapsed time in seconds (with fractional seconds).
- _Time (MM:SS)_: elapsed time in minutes and seconds (limited to a maximum of 59:59).
- No validation: the elapsed time will be stored as `h:m:s.f` (colons and dot).

For capture and lap data values other than elapsed time, the following automatic formats will be used, depending on the selected field type:

- _Integer_: the (local) time represented by number of milliseconds elapsed since the start of the epoch, 01 January, 1970 00:00:00 Universal Time (UTC).
- _Number_: as above, but in seconds (including fractional seconds).
- _Date_: The date. Time information will be lost.
- _Datetime_: The date and time. Some time information will be lost.
- No validation: A datetime value in the ISO 8601 format `yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.fff`.

### Format of the timer display

To set the display format, the following placeholders can be used:

- `/h` - hours (1 or more digits)
- `/m` - minutes (2 digits)
- `/s` - seconds (2 digits)
- `/f` - fractional seconds
- `/S` - total seconds (with fractional seconds)
- `/F` - total milliseconds
- `/g` - group separator
- `/d` - decimal separator

The display format for e.g. `0:02:33.12` can be written as `/h/g/m/g/s/d/f`, and `digits` would have to be set to `2`.

### Button and other labels

Labels of buttons and other display elements can be customized using the following parameters:

- `label_start` - Start button label. Default is 'Start'.
- `label_resume` - Resume button label. Default is 'Resume'.
- `label_stop` - Stop button label. Default is 'Stop'.
- `label_reset` - Reset button label. Default is 'Reset'.
- `label_lap` - Lap button label (also used as row label). Default is 'Lap'.
- `label_capture` - Capture button label (also used as row label). Default is 'Capture'.
- `label_elapsed` (`lap` mode only) - Header for the elapsed time column. Default is 'Lap time'.
- `label_cumulated` (`lap` mode only) - Header for the cumulated time column. Default is 'Cumulated'.

## Module Configuration

Behavior of the module can be configured at the project level:

- **Enable JavaScript debug logging**: When enabled, the module will output debug information to the browser console.

## Examples

A demo project is available [here](demo-project/StopwatchEMTest.xml).

**Simple Stopwatches** - capture elapsed time only:

![Simple](images/examples1-7.png)

1. No data captured yet. The stopwatch can be started by clicking the green 'Start' button.

   ```json
   @STOPWATCH
   ```

2. Timer has run. Can be reset.  

   ```json
   @STOPWATCH={ "digits": 2, "show_target": true }
   ```

3. Resume is enabled for this stopwatch. The stopwatch is currently stopped, but can be resumed (or reset).  

   ```json
   @STOPWATCH={ "digits": 1, "resume": true }
   ```

4. This stopwatch is currently running, as indicated by the red 'Stop' button.  

   ```json
   @STOPWATCH
   ```

5. This shows storage in a _Text Box_ without validation.  

   ```json
   @STOPWATCH={ "show_target": true }
   ```

6. This stopwatch has been configured so the user is blinded regarding the elapsed time.

   ```json
   @STOPWATCH={
      "display_format": "Blinded",
      "display_running": "Running",
      "display_empty": "--:--.--"
   }
   ```

7. This illustrates a case in which something is going wrong. A very visible error message is displayed in case of a configuration error.

**Advanced Stopwatches** - capture multiple timepoints / laps:

![JSON](images/examples8-11.png)

8. Multiple captures into a _Notes Box_ (as a JSON data structure, here shown explicitly).  

   ```json
   @STOPWATCH=
   {
     "mode": "capture",
     "resume": true,
     "show_target": true
   }
   ```

9. Shortcut for a stopwatch with a basic capture setup. No further configuration is needed. Resuming is not allowed by default.

   ```json
   @STOPWATCH-CAPTURE
   ```

10. Shortcut for a stopwatch that captures laps. Resuming is not allowed by default. The display as shown is re-constituted after saving the form.  

   ```json
   @STOPWATCH-LAP
   ```

11. A stopwatch for capturing laps, showing a _cumulated_ column. The display format has been set so that hours are not shown (the number of minutes will exceed 59) and fractional seconds are rounded to 2 digits.  

    ```json
    @STOPWATCH-LAP=
    {
      "cumulated": true,
      "no_hours": true,
      "display_format": "/m/g/s/d/f",
      "digits": 2
    }
    ```

**Advanced Stopwatches** - capture multiple timepoints / laps into a repeating instrument:

![JSON](images/example12.png)

12. Multiple captures can be stored in a repeating instrument when `mapping` data items to fields provided on a repeating instrument. The stored data is shown in the report below. Note that different field types have been set for the various items, which will determine the storage format: _Elapsed_ (integer) shows milliseconds, _Cumulated_ (number) shows cumulated time in seconds, _Start_ and _Stop_ (no validation) show JS times (local from the browser) when a lap was started and stopped, respectively, and _Time stopped?_ indicates how often the 'Stop' button was clicked during the recording of a lap.

    ```json
    @STOPWATCH-LAP=
    {
      "cumulated": true,
      "mapping": {
        "id": "stopwatch_id",
        "elapsed": "store_elapsed",
        "cumulated": "store_cumulated",
        "start": "store_start",
        "stop": "store_stop",
        "num_stops": "store_num_stops"
      },
      "resume": true
    }
    ```
